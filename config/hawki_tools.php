    |   HAWKI Tools
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    |   Tools that HAWKI can run on its own, for providers whose API does not
    |   bring a native implementation of them (e.g. the ki@JLU gateway, which
    |   speaks the OpenAI chat completions format but serves no server side
    |   tools of its own).
    |
    |   Each tool is offered as an override on the API provider edit screen:
    |   override off keeps the provider's native tool, override on routes the
    |   tool through HAWKI's own tool runtime.
    |
    |   The 'description' is sent to the model as the function description, so
    |   it decides how well the model picks the tool.
